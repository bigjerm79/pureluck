    <h3>BIO</h3>

    <p>A lot of fuckin' gentlemens playing songs they like, some of em they even wrote. Founded in 2007 as an unwieldy two-drummer, four-guitarist country-rock chain gang, the locals eventually condensed into a svelte quintet. Of course Pure Luck’s cast of characters boast résumés whose group monikers make their band members all but unemployable in most day jobs. Consider that a NSFW warning. Pure Luck is a fresh new act steaming out of Austin, Texas. They are no newbies to the music world. Vocalist/banjoman/guitarist J.D Pinkus is a veteran of the music scene. Pinkus  manhandles bass in Austin post-punk pioneers the Butthole Surfers, his boogie metal trio Honky, and, often, the Melvins. Steven Haas owner and proprietor of Haasienda studios also performs and tours with The Moistboiz. Stevage an import from Canada moonlights as a Meatloaf impersonator. Claude Coleman Jr is the drummer for alternative rock group Ween he has also worked with Eagles of Death Metal and Chocolate Genius. Cody Richardson makes his mamma proud in the Hickoids and Beaumonts. </p>
